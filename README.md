# Scripting survivale zone

In this collection you can find some script to help you to survive at technologies :-)
my plan is release all script for Linux: Ubuntu, RedHat, Suse and if possible for Winzoz

 **** today all script are tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ****
 
 All collaction is divided in more then one branch
 
 Linux.Db2 ----> find script for DB2 on Linux OS
 
 Winzoz.xxx ----> find script for xxx on Winzoz

to download it from your server run following command

wget https://github.com/net2action/Scripting/tree/<name_of_Branch> -O <fileName.tar.gz>

eg.

wget https://github.com/net2action/Scripting/tree/Linux.Db2 -O Db2Script.tar.gz

# Scripting survival zone

In this collection you can find some script to help you to survive at technologies :-)
my plan is release all script for Linux: Ubuntu, RedHat, Suse and if possible for Winzoz

 **** today all script are tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ****
 
 All collaction is divided in more then one branch
 
 Linux.Db2 ----> find script for DB2 on Linux OS
 
 Winzoz.xxx ----> find script for xxx on Winzoz

to download it from your server run following command

wget --no-check-certificate  https://api.github.com/repos/net2action/Scripting/zipball/Win -O Db2Script.zip
